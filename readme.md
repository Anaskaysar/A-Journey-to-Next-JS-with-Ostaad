# A Journey to Next Js with Ostaad

#### Module 0

<p align="justify"> 
-> It's a module of recap. Before the beginning of the course Ostaad provided us around 180 pre-recorder videos to take a look in fundamental topics of web devleopment  i.e. HTML, CSS, JS,DOM, ES6, REACT etc. The main goal is to make sure that once we are in course flow we don't have to look back. At the same time it's really important for us to have a good grasp in the all topics.
